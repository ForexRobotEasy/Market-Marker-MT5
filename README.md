# Market Maker MT5

Market Maker MT5 is a custom indicator and expert advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This code provides a template for implementing a trading algorithm using the custom indicator and includes functions for opening and closing positions.

## Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called during indicator initialization and is used to perform any necessary initialization tasks. This function should return `INIT_SUCCEEDED` upon successful initialization.

## Indicator Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called during indicator deinitialization and is used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

## Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate` function is called to calculate and process indicator values. It takes in various parameters, such as the number of rates, previous calculation index, and price data arrays. This function should return the total number of calculated rates.

## Custom Trading Functions

The `OpenPosition` and `ClosePosition` functions are used to implement the code for opening and closing positions based on trading rules.

## Trading Algorithm

The `TradingAlgorithm` function is the main algorithm for the EA. It utilizes the custom indicator and performs various tasks, including checking for peak levels of trading activity, tracking correlation of candles on all timeframes, including volume levels representing key trading activity, identifying demand and supply levels based on nearest volume levels, assigning demand and supply statuses to volume levels, and opening and closing positions based on trading rules. This function also includes necessary comments to explain the logic of the code.

## EA Initialization

The `OnInitExpert` function is called during EA initialization and is used to perform any necessary initialization tasks. This function should return `INIT_SUCCEEDED` upon successful initialization.

## EA Deinitialization

The `OnDeinitExpert` function is called during EA deinitialization and is used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

## EA Tick Processing

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick and is used to perform necessary tasks. In this code, it calls the `TradingAlgorithm` function to execute the trading algorithm.

## EA Start Function

The `OnStart` function is called to start the EA. In this code, it also calls the `TradingAlgorithm` function to execute the trading algorithm.
